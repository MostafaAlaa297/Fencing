        <p class="Rules">-In 2017 we saw a return to sanity in the 4 meters.

                         -The basic idea is simple: If you can adapt the distance of your attack, you are in preparation.
        <br><br>
                         -Be ready for the consequences.
        <br><br>
                         -Referees should split 4 meter calls with a razor, otherwise the simultaneous grind game will never die.
        <br><br>
                         -As usual, all calls on video are the final bout ref's call or video appeal call. Please do not tell us a call is wrong unless you were one of the bout referees in question. If you were the bout referee and you want to point something out, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

            <p class="Rules"> -The march in sabre has changed significantly since the introduction of the current cutoff times in 2004. Gone are the days when the attack in sabre meant that you would advance on your opponent expecting to finish with their counterattack. 
            <br><br>
                               -Over the last 10 years, sabreurs and referees have developed a whole new class of marching attacks. These marches focus on surprising the defender with rapid tempo and distance changes, rather than finishing with the counterattack. </p>
